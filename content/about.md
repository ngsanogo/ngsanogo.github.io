Since 2017, I've been building data systems in contexts where **reliability is non-negotiable**: healthcare, medical research, patient data.

This experience taught me one thing: the value of a data platform is not measured by its technical complexity, but by the **trust** you can place in its data.

## My approach

I'm not an engineer who just codes pipelines. I'm someone who **understands business needs**, proposes adapted solutions, and ensures they work in the long run.

In practice, this means:

- **Scope before building** — Understand the real problem, not the imagined one
- **Favor simplicity** — A maintainable solution beats a technical feat
- **Ensure quality** — Reliable, documented, actionable data
- **Support teams** — Transfer knowledge, train, enable autonomy

## Beliefs

> *Simple is better than complex. Readability counts.*

These Zen of Python principles guide my work. I believe the best data systems are:

- **Understandable** by those who use them
- **Maintainable** by those who inherit them
- **Reliable** for those who make decisions with them

Tech hype doesn't interest me. What interests me is data that truly serves those who need it.
