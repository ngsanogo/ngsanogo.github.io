## Content Principles

1. **Useful over clever** - Every article solves a real problem
2. **Depth over breadth** - Go deep on topics, avoid surface-level content
3. **Code examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Practical patterns** - Real-world applicable, not theoretical
5. **Original perspective** - Say something new, not rehashed basics
6. **No fluff** - Every sentence earns its place
